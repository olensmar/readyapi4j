# ReadyAPI4j Maven Plugin Samples

This module contains [sample recipes](src/test/resources/recipes) in JSON format that are 
executed via the Maven plugin as defined in the pom.xml using one of the RunSamplesLocally or 
 RunSampleRemotely profiles. 

You can run these samples using the local execution engine with

```
mvn integration-test -PRunSamplesLocally
```

You can run these samples using the remote execution engine with

```
mvn integration-test -PRunSamplesRemotely
```

By default the remote execution will use the public TestEngine instance available at 
http://testengine.readyapi.io/ - change the defined endpoint properties in the pom to execute 
with a different server.
